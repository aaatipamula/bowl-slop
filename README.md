The code can be run with the following commands:

> `python3` version `>=3.9` must be installed. The `data.txt` file must exist next to `final.py`.

```sh
# Get the code
git checkout https://github.com/aaatipamula/bowl-slop.git
# Change directories to the source code directory
cd bowl-slop
# Run the code
python3 final.py
```

The `debug` flag can be added when running `final.py` to show a live and more detailed output. This will show the traceback for rejected strings as well.

```sh
python3 final.py debug
```
